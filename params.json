{"name":"WPSkypeStatus","tagline":"Simple PHP Class for making Skype Call links - include in your PHP project or copy the files to your WordPress plugins folder!","body":"# WPSkypeStatus #\r\n\r\nInitially to be a WordPress plugin, now being written to work as either a WP plugin or in any PHP project via a single `include` statement.\r\n\r\nThe images I use are square resolutions, named according to status and size as `(online|offline|away|dnd|group).(16|32|64).png` with 16px being the default size. [Originals can be found here](http://vector.us/browse/253348/skype_status_icons).\r\n\r\n## About ##\r\n\r\nYou can manually layout and write your own Skype Call links, but doing that every time can be a hassle. The new Skype URI builder creates the link for you, including pulling the images from the Skype servers for you, but doesn't allow for any sort of differentiation between your Skype statuses - your users won't know if you're online, offline, away, etc.\r\n\r\nThus, I decided to make a simple PHP Class that will create structured Skype call links complete with icons and classes for styling - works as both a normal PHP `include` or as a WordPress plugin!\r\n\r\n## Instructions ##\r\n\r\nFor instructions on how to use this project, please see the included [INSTRUCTIONS.md file](/INSTRUCTIONS.md) for details.\r\n\r\n## To Do ##\r\n\r\nIn the order I'm going to work on them, the things I want to achieve before labelling this project as having reached version 1.0 -\r\n\r\n1.
