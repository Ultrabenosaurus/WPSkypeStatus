# WPSkypeStatus #

Initially to be a WordPress plugin, now being written to work as either a WP plugin or in any PHP project via a single `include` statement.

**This is the dev branch - code form here will almost certainly not be usable in it's current state. Use at your own risk.**

## Introduction ##

You can manually layout and write your own Skype Call links in WordPress, but doing that every time can be a hassle. The new Skype URI builder creates the link for you, including pulling the images from the Skype servers for you, but doesn't allow for any sort of differentiation between your Skype statuses - your users won't know if you're online, offline, away, etc.

Thus, I decided to make a simple WordPress plugin that will create structured Skype call links complete with icons and classes for styling from a single shortcode.
